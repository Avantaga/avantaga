## Getting started

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/fmiddernacht/avantaga.git`
2. Open in VS Code or run scripts in Google Colab
3. See `CLAUDE.md` for project conventions

## Tools

- **VS Code** — local editing
- **GitHub Desktop** — version control GUI
- **Claude Code** — AI coding agent (reads `CLAUDE.md` for context)
- **Google Colab** — notebook execution (`File → Open from GitHub`)
- **Google Drive** — large files and shared deliverables (not in this repo)

## Data policy

Large datasets and exports belong on Google Drive, not in this repo. The `data/` folder is for small reference files only (< 5 MB).
